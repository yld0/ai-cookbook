# AI Implementation Handbook for Dutch Government Organizations

## About This Handbook

This handbook has been developed by the **Bureau AI-Implementatie** (BAI) of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK) to support Dutch government organizations in the responsible implementation of AI systems.

## 1. General Principles

### 1.1 Transparency
All AI systems must be transparent. Government organizations must be able to clearly explain how an AI system works and what decisions it makes.

### 1.2 Accountability
There must always be a human responsible for AI decisions. Automation must not lead to a lack of accountability.

### 1.3 Non-Discrimination
AI systems must not cause unjustified discrimination. Systems must be regularly tested for bias and unfair treatment.

### 1.4 Privacy and Data Protection
AI systems must comply with GDPR. Personal data must be protected and only used with a valid legal basis.

## 2. Mandatory Steps for AI Implementation

### 2.1 Impact Assessment (IAMA)
Before an AI system is implemented, an **Impact Assessment for Human Rights and Algorithms (IAMA)** must be performed. This assessment evaluates:
- Impact on fundamental rights
- Risks to citizens
- Measures to mitigate risks

### 2.2 Registration in Algorithm Register
All AI systems with impact on citizens must be registered in the [Algorithm Register](https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/). This applies particularly to:
- High-risk AI systems
- Systems that make decisions about individuals
- Systems used for supervision or enforcement

### 2.3 Security (BIO)
AI systems must comply with the **Baseline Information Security Government (BIO)**. This includes:
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Access control and authentication
- Monitoring and logging
- Incident response procedures

### 2.4 Human Oversight
There must always be human oversight of AI decisions, especially for:
- High-risk decisions
- Decisions with significant impact on individuals
- New or untested AI systems

## 3. Categories of AI Systems

### 3.1 Low-Risk Systems
Examples: chatbots, automatic document categorization
- Requirements: Basic transparency, registration optional
- Oversight: Periodic review

### 3.2 Medium-Risk Systems
Examples: Fraud detection, risk profiles
- Requirements: IAMA mandatory, registration in Algorithm Register
- Oversight: Regular monitoring and evaluation

### 3.3 High-Risk Systems
Examples: Decisions on benefits, criminal assessments
- Requirements: Extensive IAMA, mandatory registration, strict security
- Oversight: Continuous monitoring, human review mandatory

## 4. Compliance and Oversight

### 4.1 Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP)
The AP is the coordinating supervisor for algorithms and AI. Organizations must:
- Cooperate with AP during inspections
- Report data breaches
- Comply with GDPR requirements

### 4.2 Internal Audit
Organizations must regularly conduct internal audits to verify that:
- AI systems function correctly
- Security measures are effective
- Compliance requirements are met

## 5. Best Practices

### 5.1 Documentation
Maintain detailed documentation of:
- How the AI system works
- What data is used
- How decisions are made
- Test results and validation

### 5.2 Training
Ensure that employees working with AI systems:
- Understand how the system works
- Know when human intervention is needed
- Are trained in AI literacy

### 5.3 Testing and Validation
Regularly test AI systems for:
- Accuracy
- Bias and discrimination
- Security vulnerabilities
- Regulatory compliance
